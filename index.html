    <h1>Line Chart</h1>
    <div id="Line_chart"></div>
    <p>
        The top line chart displays fluctuations in temperature (in Celsius) over a specific time period (from May 19 to
        September 15), showing the high variance in daily temperatures, with temperatures ranging from around 5째C to over
        40째C. </p>
    <p>The bottom line chart tracks a more stable temperature trend over the same period, suggesting lower temperature
            variance. The yellow line represents a less extreme range, possibly the lower or average temperature in the same time frame.</p> 
   

    <h1>Choropleth Map</h1>
    <div id="Dot_choropleth_map"></div>
    <p>
        This world map highlights the top high-temperature countries, using a gradient color scale to indicate temperature ranges
        (from around 20째C to 40째C). The countries with high temperatures are marked with red dots, and the map shows a global
        distribution with a concentration of high temperatures in regions around the equator and certain hotspots in Africa, the
        Middle East, and parts of Asia. The color bar to the right indicates the intensity of the temperature.
